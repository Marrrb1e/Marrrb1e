Hi, I recently will get my bachelor's degree in Southern University of Science and Technology (Sustech) in China. And I will continue my study in the same school as an Eng.D student in microelectronics.

My interest is about digital circuits including digital signal processing, wireless communications and computing-in-memory. But my knowledge is so poor that I need to work hard to adapt to my Eng.D status. So I will take every suggestion seriously to get myself better. ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­

I am looking forward to your suggestions on anything. Everyone could try contacting me. ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°
